# Product list page

This is a project I undertook to advance my skills using [Vue](https://reactjs.org/) and other parts of its ecosystem. 
Page  contains a list of products. You can filter products using categories, as well as in the search bar to find specific products. Data fetched from [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/). The page has an adaptive layout that looks great both on the desktop and in the mobile version.
Also I made the same project with [React](https://github.com/allexz10/product-list)
